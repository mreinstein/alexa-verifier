# alexa-verifier

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mreinstein/alexa-verifier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mreinstein/alexa-verifier)

Verify HTTP requests sent to an Alexa skill are sent from Amazon.

This module is framework-agnostic.

If you're using expressjs, you should check out [alexa-verifier-middleware](https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-verifier-middleware) which is a lot easier to integrate.



### motivation
Part of the certication process for alexa skills hosted on a generic web service (i.e., not AWS Lambda) is that your skill must validate requests are actually coming from Amazon. This is enforced by checking:

* the timestamp of the request
* the validity of the certificate
* the signature of the the request signed with the aforementioned certificate

This module provides a function to handle this validation.


### usage

arguments
* `cert_url`  full url of the certificate to verify (from HTTP request header named `signaturecertchainurl`)
* `signature` signature of the request (from HTTP request header named `signature`)
* `requestRawBody`  full body string from POST request
* `callback`  (optional) completion function. has 1 argument which indicates error. falsey when verification passes

You may include a callback function, in the standard node error argument-first format:

```javascript
const verifier = require('alexa-verifier')


verifier(cert_url, signature, requestRawBody, function callbackFn(er) {
  // if er, something went wrong
})
```

* `cert_url`  full url of the certificate to verify (from HTTP request header named `signaturecertchainurl`)
* `signature` signature of the request (from HTTP request header named `signature`)
* `requestRawBody`  full body string from POST request
* `callback`  completion function. has 1 argument which indicates error. falsey when verification passes

### using with a proxy
If you're hosting your web service behind a proxy, you may have trouble retrieving the Amazon cert from S3. As long as you have your http_proxy/HTTP_PROXY environment variable set, the https module will update the agent to use your proxy.

```
http_proxy=http://<your-proxy>:<port>
```
Ommiting a callback function returns a promise:
```javascript
const verifier = require('alexa-verifier')


const verifyPromise = verifier(cert_url, signature, requestRawBody)
```
